**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Project Description**

Spots is an interactive web page that allows the user to upload images for visitors to view. The user can edit their profile allowing to add an avatar image, their name and a bit about themselves. There is a button to create a new post which will allow the user to add a photo and description. Visitors to the page will be able to view the profile, photos and the ability to like photos. This is a responsive site which was built for desktop and can smoothly transition to tablet and mobile views.

This was built using a combination of flexbox, grids, hover states and media queries to handle transitions to multiple screens.
